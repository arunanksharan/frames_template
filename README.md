# frames_template

A generic template for all the components required to build Farcaster Frames App

Scaffolding a frames app for Farcaster became repetitive since it required similar components:

1. APIs
2. Config
3. Images and Satori
4. Interfaces and Types
5. Pages
6. Screens
7. Server
8. Utils

I needed to initialise these folders every time I was building a frame. So, created a template which I take a clone and change the remote to my actual frames project. Saves me a bunch of repetitive work.
